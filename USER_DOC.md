# NGINX
	# used as a reverse proxy and to redirect requests from the clients to the appropriate origin server
	# responses generated by the origin server is also sent back to the client via reverse proxy
	# reverse proxy can also act as a load balancer when it decides which backend server handles the request. May be based on # factors such as server availability, server load, geographic location etc
	# caching - frequently accessed content can be cached and served directly from the reverse proxy rather then from the backend servers
	# security - can mask the origin server's identity, hiding the IP address from the client -> increase difficulty for attackers to target the server directly
	# Secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption - encryption and decryption can happen on the reverse proxy layer rather than on the origin server
	# reverse proxy -> positioned in front of the origin servers; protects the origin servers from the clients
	# forward proxy -> positioned in front of the clients; protects the clients from the internet
	# in this case, NGINX acts as the public entry point. Accepts requests from port 443 using TLS v1.3 / TLS v1.2
